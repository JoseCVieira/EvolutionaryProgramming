# Evolutionary

Evolutive programming modeled, implemented with objects for Object-Oriented Programming course

### Description:

Consider a grid n × m. We want to find the best path, that is, the path with lowest cost between
an initial point, with coordinates (xi, yi), and a final point, with coordinates (xf , yf ). Each path
has an associated cost that is determined by the number of edges traversed. In general, the
cost of each edge is 1, but there may be special areas where the cost is higher. There are nobst
obstacles at some points on the grid through which one can not proceed.
For instance, consider the following figure which represents a grid 5 × 4:

</p>

In this figure, the initial point, marked with 	⊙, has coordinates (1, 1), the end point, marked with
⊕, has coordinates (5, 4), the obstacles are marked with ⚫, and the edges of the special cost areas,
indicated by dashed, have cost 4. In this case, the best path is (1, 1),(1, 2),(2, 2),(3, 2),(3, 1),(4, 1),
(5, 1),(5, 2),(5, 3),(5, 4) with cost 12. There are shorter paths but whose cost is higher. For
example, the path (1, 1),(1, 2),(2, 2),(3, 2),(3, 3),(4, 3),(5, 3),(5, 4) is shorter but its cost is 13.
